    <h2>The Early Days of HTTP</h2>
    <p>
      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) began in 1991 at CERN, created by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> as part of the first web system.
      The initial version, called <strong>HTTP/0.9</strong>, could only retrieve simple HTML pages using a single command called <code>GET</code>.
      There were no headers, status codes, or support for images and scripts. It was enough for the early web when pages were mostly plain text.
    </p>

    <h2>Expansion and HTTP/1.0</h2>
    <p>
      As the web grew, more features were needed. In 1996, <strong>HTTP/1.0</strong> introduced headers, allowing browsers and servers
      to share details like content type and caching information. It also added methods such as <code>POST</code> so users could submit data
      through forms. However, each file required a new connection, slowing websites with multiple images or resources.
    </p>

    <h2>HTTP/1.1 and the Web Boom</h2>
    <p>
      Released in 1997, <strong>HTTP/1.1</strong> became the foundation of the modern web. It allowed persistent connections,
      chunked data transfer, and the use of host headersâ€”making it possible for many websites to share one IP address.
      This version powered the growth of the internet during the early 2000s and remains widely used today.
